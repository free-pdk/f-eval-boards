These are evalution boards for the online-programmable MTP (as opposed to the OTP parts, which can only be programmed offline and once) Padauk µC.

They are free; you can redistribute them and/or modify them under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

Currently there are these board designs:

* f-eval-pdk-s08:  For the PFC232 and PFS172 in 8-pin SOIC package.
* f-eval-pdk-s08a: For the PFC151, PFC154, PFC161, PFS154 and PFS173 in 8-pin SOIC package.
* f-eval-pdk-s08b: For the PFC161 in 8-pin SOIC package.
* f-eval-pdk-s16:  For the PFC154, PFS154 and PFS173 in 16-pin SOIC package.
* f-eval-pdk-s16a: For the PFC232 and PFS172 in 16-pin SOIC package.

The board designs (pfs154-so16 and pfs232-so16) feature:

* Micro-USB connector for optional power supply from USB and an LED to indicate USB power.
* Pin headers allowing easy access to all pins on the package.
* Extra pin header for the pins relevant to online programming.
* 4 LED at I/O pins.
* Hand-solderable component packages.
