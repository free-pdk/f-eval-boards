These are evalution boards for the online-programmable MTP (as opposed to the OTP parts, which can only be programmed offline and once) Padauk µC.

They are free; you can redistribute them and/or modify them under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

Currently there are these board designs:

* pfs154: For the PFS154 and PFS173 in 16-pin SOIC package.
* pfs232: For the PFS232 and PFC232 in 16-pin SOIC package (as of 2019-01-16 these devices are not yet available).

Both board designs feature:

* Micro-USB connector for optional power supply from USB and an LED to indicate USB power.
* Pin headers allowing easy access to all pins on the package.
* Extra pin header for the pins relevant to online programming.
* 4 LED at I/O pins.
* Hand-solderable component packages.

Tools used:

* gschem for the schematic
* pcb-rnd for the pcb design
