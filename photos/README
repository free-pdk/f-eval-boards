These are photos of current prototypes of the f-eval boards.

They are hand-soldered and the colophonium hasn't been cleared.

But they work.

The photos of the f-eval-pdk-s08 and f-eval-pdk-s08a show the current board design.

The photos of the f-eval-pdk-s16 and f-eval-pdk-s16a show an older version (hard-to-read label on the programming header due to soldermask).
